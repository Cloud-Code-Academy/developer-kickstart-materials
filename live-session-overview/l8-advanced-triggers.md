# Lesson 8 Instructor Guide: Advanced Trigger Best Practices (Trigger Frameworks)

## Lesson Summary

In this lesson, students will move beyond basic trigger syntax and explore **how to write scalable, maintainable, and testable trigger logic**. They'll learn about why trigger frameworks are necessary, how to implement them, and how to avoid anti-patterns like logic in the trigger body. The session will focus on understanding **single-responsibility design, handler classes, and framework structure** with real-world demos and discussion.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

-   Explain the problems with unstructured triggers in large orgs
-   Describe the benefits of using a trigger framework
-   Implement a basic trigger framework with a handler class
-   Avoid logic in trigger bodies and adhere to single-responsibility principles
-   Write unit tests for trigger handlers

---

## Lesson Structure (Total Time: \~90 minutes)

### 1. Warm-Up & Review (5–10 min)

-   Briefly revisit the goals of triggers:

    -   Enforce business rules
    -   Automate behavior on record change

-   Ask students: “What problems might arise as orgs scale with many triggers?”

---

### 2. Problem: Messy Triggers Without Structure (10–15 min)

-   **Demo:** A monolithic trigger with logic directly in the body:

    ```apex
    trigger ContactTrigger on Contact (before insert) {
        for (Contact c : Trigger.new) {
            if (String.isBlank(c.FirstName)) {
                c.FirstName = 'Default';
            }
        }
    }
    ```

-   Discuss problems:

    -   Hard to test
    -   Hard to reuse
    -   Easy to duplicate logic
    -   No separation of concerns

-   Key concept: **Avoid putting logic in the trigger itself**

---

### 3. Solution: Trigger Handlers & Frameworks (15–20 min)

-   Introduce the concept of a **Trigger Handler** class

-   Split trigger structure into:

    -   Trigger file: only routes logic
    -   Handler class: contains business logic

-   **Demo: Basic Handler Class**

    ```apex
    trigger ContactTrigger on Contact (before insert) {
        if (Trigger.isBefore && Trigger.isInsert) {
            new ContactTriggerHandler().beforeInsert(Trigger.new);
        }
    }

    public class ContactTriggerHandler {
        public void beforeInsert(List<Contact> newContacts) {
            for (Contact c : newContacts) {
                if (String.isBlank(c.FirstName)) {
                    c.FirstName = 'Default';
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

-   Talk through the structure and control flow

-   Benefits:

    -   Test handler methods in isolation
    -   Predictable trigger behavior
    -   Easy to debug and scale

---

### 4. Handling Multiple Events (Insert, Update, Delete) (10–15 min)

-   Expand the handler pattern to support more than one event

-   Add `beforeUpdate`, `afterInsert`, etc., methods

-   **Use Case from Transcript:** Populate or sync a related field in both `before insert` and `before update`

-   Optional: use an interface-based approach for cleaner design

---

### 5. Building a Reusable Framework (20–25 min)

-   Discuss common open-source patterns (e.g., Kevin Poorman, Nebula, FFLib)

-   If using your academy's internal framework, introduce the shared base class:

    ```apex
    public abstract class TriggerHandler {
        public void beforeInsert(List<SObject> newList) {}
        public void beforeUpdate(List<SObject> newList, Map<Id, SObject> oldMap) {}
        public void afterInsert(List<SObject> newList) {}
        // ... more as needed
    }
    ```

-   Then implement specific handlers:

    ```apex
    public class AccountHandler extends TriggerHandler {
        public override void beforeInsert(List<SObject> newList) {
            List<Account> accounts = (List<Account>)newList;
            for (Account a : accounts) {
                a.Description = 'Handled';
            }
        }
    }
    ```

-   Demonstrate routing logic in the trigger itself

    ```apex
    trigger AccountTrigger on Account (before insert, before update) {
        TriggerHandler handler = new AccountHandler();
        if (Trigger.isBefore) {
            if (Trigger.isInsert) handler.beforeInsert(Trigger.new);
            if (Trigger.isUpdate) handler.beforeUpdate(Trigger.new, Trigger.oldMap);
        }
    }
    ```

---

### 6. Unit Testing Trigger Handlers (10–15 min)

-   Show how testing becomes simpler with handler methods

-   **Example Test Class:**

    ```apex
    @isTest
    public class ContactTriggerHandlerTest {
        @isTest
        static void testBeforeInsert() {
            Contact c = new Contact(LastName='Smith');
            insert c;

            Contact result = [SELECT FirstName FROM Contact WHERE Id = :c.Id];
            System.assertEquals('Default', result.FirstName);
        }
    }
    ```

-   Key tip from transcript: emphasize isolating logic into handler methods allows you to test just the handler logic in non-trigger contexts too.

---

### 7. Common Pitfalls and Best Practices (10 min)

-   Avoid DML or SOQL inside loops (re-emphasized from earlier lessons)
-   Don’t allow triggers to call other triggers without control (guarding with static variables)
-   Centralize logic when possible (e.g. TriggerDispatcher)
-   Keep logic testable and modular

---

### Instructor Tips

-   Use a **real business use case** (e.g., setting default field values or syncing related data) to ground each trigger
-   Encourage students to **read debug logs** to follow flow
-   Help students understand **where their logic lives now** (trigger vs handler)
-   Show them how a bad pattern becomes a nightmare in production-scale orgs
-   Allow time for live refactoring: show bad → improve → test

Let me know if you'd like this turned into slides or if you'd like the framework code turned into reusable modules for student starter packs.
